# Predictive Analysis of Business Turnover using Python and Linear Regression
This project offers a practical example of utilizing Python's vast ecosystem of libraries to conduct predictive analysis on business turnover data. Leveraging libraries like pandas, numpy, and statsmodels, the project demonstrates the power of Python in data extraction, manipulation, and predictive modeling.

# Overview
The project's objective is to predict the turnover of businesses (both large companies and SMEs) in 2021 based on a decade-long (2012-2021) historical turnover data. The project's pipeline involves data cleaning, preprocessing, model fitting, and prediction. All these stages have been automated using Python, showcasing the language's potential in building end-to-end data analysis workflows.

# Getting Started
Before you can run the project, you need to install several Python libraries. You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy statsmodels
```

## Usage
To run the project, you need two CSV files: 'Large_company_Turnover_2012-2021.csv' and 'SMEs_Turnover_2012-2021.csv'. These files should contain the turnover data for large companies and SMEs from 2012 to 2021.

After placing these files in the same directory as the script, run the Python script using any Python 3.x interpreter:

```
python regression_analysis.py
```

## Dependencies
pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
numpy: for performing numerical operations
statsmodels: for constructing and fitting the regression model
Results
The script outputs a summary of the regression model, including the R-squared value, coefficients for each predictor, standard errors, and p-values for each predictor. The script uses these coefficients to predict the turnover for the year 2021.

## Conclusion
This project emphasizes the potential of Python in predictive analysis and automation. By harnessing the power of Python's library ecosystem, it's possible to automate complex processes like data cleaning, preprocessing, and predictive modeling, allowing businesses to derive actionable insights from their data.

## Future Directions
In the future, more sophisticated models like time series analysis or machine learning models could be integrated to improve the prediction accuracy. The pipeline could also be expanded to include data visualization using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn for more intuitive data interpretation.
